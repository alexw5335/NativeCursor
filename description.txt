Replaces the cursor with the native operating system's cursor
- Fixes floaty cursor, which is caused by vsync
- The cursor will now move much more fluidly and it will not lag behind
- Probably incompatible with any mods that change the cursor
- Might not work on all computers and operating systems
- I haven't tested it much, so there may be some issues
- Anything that follows the cursor (e.g. tooltips and dragged items) will unfortunately now lag behind the cursor.
