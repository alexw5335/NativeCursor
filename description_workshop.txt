Replaces the cursor with the native operating system's cursor
- Updated to 1.4.4
- Fixes laggy/floaty cursor, which is caused by v-sync
- Probably incompatible with any mods that change the cursor
- Only tested on Windows, may not work on all operating systems
- Added contextual cursors for smart cursor, quick trash, favourite, etc.
- Config to change contextual cursor graphics, with some custom graphics provided
- Has options for larger and brighter cursors
