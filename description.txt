Replaces the cursor with the native operating system's cursor
- Fixes laggy/floaty cursor, which is caused by v-sync
- Probably incompatible with any mods that change the cursor
- Only tested on Windows, may not work on all operating systems
- Anything that follows the cursor (e.g. tooltips and dragged items) will unfortunately now lag behind the cursor
- Added contextual cursors for smart cursor, quick trash, favourite, etc.
- Config to change contextual cursor graphics, with some custom graphics provided
